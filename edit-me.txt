When I type learn into the Terminal I receive the following, what or where did I wrong turn in the setup of my learn.co?  
Coughinathartic:~ fg$ learn
Usage: learn ex<exercise_number>.rb
Coughinathartic:~ fg$ 'learn'
Usage: learn ex<exercise_number>.rb
Coughinathartic:~ fg$ learn
Usage: learn ex<exercise_number>.rb
Coughinathartic:~ fg$ 

Also my learn open was unsuccessful also, it requested an account
