"Life is but a poor player that struts and frets his hour on the stage. It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing"

"To be or not to be? That is the question. Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against, and by opposing end them."
