# First Lab Ruby Learn Cli Osx

## Objectives

1. Open a lab by clicking "Open" on this page on Learn.co.
2. Run the lab's tests with the `learn` CLI command.
3. Make a change to your local copy of this lab.
4. Pass the tests using the `learn` CLI command.
5. Submit the passing lab with the `learn submit` CLI command.

## Overview

Now that you've learned all about how to work on Lab's on Learn, we're going to practice using the Learn CLI to work on this very lab. To complete this lab you need to:

1. Open the lab with the Learn CLI
2. Make a change to the `edit-me.txt` file or add a new file.
3. Submit the lab with the Learn CLI

## Instructions

This lab is just about practicing the lab workflow on Learn using the `learn` CLI.

1. Click on the "Open" link on the lab toolbar above.

  After you click on this, your Terminal should popup and open the lab locally by forking it on GitHub, cloning your fork, and `cd`ing into the lab's directory, and opening your editor.

2. After the lab is opened, your terminal should be in the lab's directory and your text editor should be opened.

  This setup, a terminal in the lab's directory and the lab directory open in an editor like Sublime or Atom, that's the state you want to be in when working on a lab on Learn. It means you're ready.

3. From your terminal, run the test suite by typing `learn` and hitting enter. You'll see something simlar to:

  *Note: My prompt is `// â™¥`, yours might be different. You'll see a terminal prompt generally represented by a `$`. That indicates you're suppose to be typing in terminal.*

  You can see your test is currently failing, which is fine, we haven't done any work yet, so it makes sense.

  The failure reads: `Make sure you have added a new file or edited edit-me.txt`

4. To pass this lab, either make any change to the content of `edit-me.txt` or create a new file.

  You can open `edit-me.txt` and you'll see it is currently empty. Add anything to that file, save the file, and then run `learn`, everything should pass.

  You can also pass this lab by creating a new file. From Terminal, you can run `touch new-file` to create a new file. Or use your text editor to create a new file and save it. If a new file is added to this lab, when you run `learn`, your tests should pass.

5. Once your local tests are passing, you can submit this lab by running `learn submit` from your terminal.

  You should see this lab pass on Learn.co, congratulations!
